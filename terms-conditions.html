                                        <li>The Client acknowledges and agrees that the utilization of databases is an inherent and integral component of the service offering. Such databases may be hosted within shared, virtual private server, or dedicated server environments, and may, by nature of the service, include data pertaining to multiple clients utilizing the software. Visual Softech's liability with respect to such server environments, including but not limited to management, performance, security, or availability of data, as well as issues attributable to the shared nature of the infrastructure, is governed by the provisions set forth in Clause 12.6 of this Agreement.</li>
                                        <li>In the event The Client requires server migration—whether to a server procured by The Client or by Visual Softech—The Client shall bear all associated costs for data transfer and configuration.</li>

This includes, without limitation, performance monitoring, security patching, uptime assurance, disaster recovery planning, and the deployment of software updates or releases provided by Visual Softech. In such cases, Visual Softech shall only be liable for issues directly related to the software it supplies.</li>
                                        <li>There is currently no licensing fees associated with the coding languages, libraries, or packages used in the development of the supplied software.

                                        <li>No security audit shall be conducted by Visual Softech unless explicitly requested in writing by The Client. Any costs associated with such audits shall be borne solely by The Client.</li>
